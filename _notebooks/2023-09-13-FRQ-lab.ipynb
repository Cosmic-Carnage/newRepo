    "This question involves the implementation of a fitness tracking system that is represented by the `StepTracker` class. A `StepTracker` object is created with a parameter that defines the minimum number of steps that must be taken for a day to be considered active. The `StepTracker` class provides a constructor and the following methods.\n",
