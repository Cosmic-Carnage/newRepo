## Collegeboard Prep

- [MCQ Blog](https://ethan.nighthawkcodingsociety.com/2023/12/21/MCQ-Reflections_IPYNB_2_.html)
- Taking a similar approach to last year, which was watching videos on the units I missed while practicing with quizzes and reading the AP CSA textbook. So far, this has been going well and it helped me succeed previously, so I will continue to take this approach. 

## Project Planning

- [Data Sets Research](https://github.com/orgs/The-GPT-Warriors/projects/1/views/1?layout=board&pane=issue&itemId=49719821)
- Our team agreed on an idea brought up by Anthony Bazhenov, which was to train a machine learning model to recognize sign language. This model would then be able to interpret what someone is saying through the use of a camera and allow the person to speak through the computer. The goal is for this to be a useful application for those who cannot speak with their voice, as well as to do more research into machine learning as a whole.
